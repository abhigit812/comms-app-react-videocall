## Run the demo directly

You can deploy the Dolby.io Video Call app without needing to clone and build the app using the `Deploy to Netlify` button. You will need:

- A Netlify account to which you're logged into
- Your Dolby.io App key and secret

Refer to [this guide](#how-to-get-a-dolbyio-account) on how to obtain your Dolby.io tokens.

[![Deploy to Netlify from fork](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/dolbyio-samples/comms-app-react-videocall)

## Getting Started

The following steps will quickly get you started testing the Dolby.io Communications Platform.

### Pre-requisites

To get started building this app you will need a Dolby.io account and access token. You will also need the following -

- [Node v18.0.0 or higher](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
- [NPM v8.11 or higher](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)
- [Yarn v1.22.19](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#mac-stable)

### How to get a Dolby.io account

To setup your Dolby.io account, go to [Dolby.io dashboard](https://dashboard.dolby.io) and complete the form. After confirming your email address, you will be logged in.

> If you did not receive a verification email, check your Spam or Junk email folders.

#### Setting up your [Dolby.io](https://dashboard.dolby.io) app

To set up your app, you will need to go to the _Dashboard_. Inside the `Communications and Media` tab, click `Create app` if you do not have an existing app. ![dashboard](documentation/assets/create.png)

### Repo structure

- The `videocall/src/` directory contains all the front-end code for the video calling app. Within this directory

  - `hooks/` contains wrapper functions around our SDK for re-usable functionality.
  - `components/` contains UI components that encapsulate and provide functionality.
  - `utils/` provides some generic helper functions.
  - `context/` contains the React Context for the side drawer and the main component window.

- The `backend/` contains the code for the proxy server.

This project is built with the [Comms UI Kit for react](https://github.com/dolbyio/comms-uikit-react) library for simplicity and re-use of standard Communications API based components.

### Setup the `.env` file

Create a new file called `.env` in the `videocall` folder, and copy the contents of `.env.example` into it.
You will need to provide the values for `KEY` and `SECRET` from your dolby.io app. To obtain your key and secret from the Dolby.io dashboard,

1. Go to the _Dashboard_, and click on the `API Keys` next to your application.

2. On the next screen, copy the `App key` and `App secret` and paste them in your `.env` file against the marked variables.
